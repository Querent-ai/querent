# Querter Actors

Actors in this model operate independently and communicate through message passing, a design that inherently supports concurrency and non-blocking operation. Let's briefly analyze some key aspects:

Actor Trait and Lifecycle: The Actor trait defines the lifecycle of an actor with methods like initialize, on_drained_messages, and finalize. This structure allows for clear management of an actor's lifespan and behavior, which is essential in a concurrent environment.

Message Handling: The Handler and DeferableReplyHandler traits define how actors process messages. Messages are handled asynchronously (async fn), allowing actors to perform operations without blocking the system. This is key for maintaining system responsiveness and efficiency.

Actor Exit Status: The ActorExitStatus enum describes different exit conditions for an actor, such as success, failure, or termination due to external signals. This provides a mechanism for gracefully handling different termination scenarios.

Queue Capacity: The queue_capacity method allows specifying the capacity of the message queue for each actor. This is an important aspect of managing the load and preventing resource exhaustion.

Observable State: Actors can expose observable states, which are useful for monitoring, debugging, and testing. This feature is particularly important in distributed and concurrent systems.

Runtime Handle: Actors can specify their preferred runtime environment, allowing for flexible deployment strategies depending on their workload characteristics.
